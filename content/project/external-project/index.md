summary: We build a wine recommendation engine using wine reviews. Wines are very overwhelming due to the sheer variety and lack of consistent categorization. This tool can help buyers navigate many wine options and help sellers procure wines that fits consumer demand. Existing solutions out there (Vivino, Delectable) are restrictive, as they only allow users to search by wine name, grape type, price. Our wine recommender fills the gap by letting users enter free-form queries to search for wines that fit their tastes.
